# TMDB Recommendation Flow

**Author**: Mr. Polakorn Anatapakorn

## Description

TMDB Recommendation Flow is a modern data pipeline project designed to automate and streamline movie recommendation dataset generation using **Apache Airflow**, **Apache Spark**, and **Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery)**. The pipeline processes TMDB movie data through several ETL stages—cleansing, transformation, exporting, and modeling—to produce ready-to-use data for recommendation systems.

---

## Project Overview

The pipeline is orchestrated using **Airflow DAGs**, processes data using **Apache Spark**, and stores it in **BigQuery**. Output can be used for content-based or collaborative filtering movie recommendation systems.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- GCP service account credentials (for BigQuery & GCS)

### Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/6587093polakornming/TMDB_RecoFlow.git
cd TMDB_RecoFlow

# Copy and configure your environment variables
cp example.env .env

# Build and start the services
docker-compose up --build
```

Ensure your GCP credentials and environment variables (e.g., project ID, bucket name) are correctly configured in `.env`.

---

## Usage

1. **Airflow UI**:
   - Access at `http://localhost:8080`
   - Trigger DAGs manually or set a schedule

2. **Workflow Path**:
   - Airflow DAGs: `airflow/dags/`
   - Spark Scripts: `spark/app/`
   - Notebooks: `eda/`

3. **ETL Process**:
   - Ingest and validate movie data
   - Clean and transform using Spark
   - Export to BigQuery
   - Run model to generate recommendations

---

## Airflow Connection
Airflow uses the following external service connections:

### 🧠 Spark Connection
- Airflow uses `SparkSubmitOperator` to submit Spark jobs.
- Connection string:
  ```bash
  spark://spark-master:7077
  ```
- This is defined as `spark_default` in `docker-compose.yml`.

### ☁️ Google Cloud Connection
- Airflow interacts with BigQuery and GCS using the connection ID:
  ```bash
  google_cloud_default
  ```
- This connection must be configured in the Airflow UI or via environment variables.
- The service account must have permission to:
  - Access BigQuery project: `YOUR-GCP-PROJECT-ID`
  - Read/write from GCS bucket: `YOUR-GCS-BUCKET-NAME`
- Ensure the service account key is available in your container and properly mounted..
